You can change a cell’s type using the “Cell” menu at the top of the page; go to `Cell > Cell Type` and select either `Code` for Python code or `Markdown` for text. (You can also change this for the current cell using the drop-down menu in the toolbar.)\n",

You can hit `Enter` or click in the cell to edit its contents again. Text in `Markdown` cells is rendered according to a set of conventions called Markdown. Markdown is a simple language for marking up text with basic text formatting information (such as bold, italics, hyperlinks, tables, etc.).\n",
